# Leetcode Questions

A partially finished set of leetcode questions that have been implemented in
Scala 3.

### Structure

The majority of questions are implemented as a function / set of functions
inside an object. Similar questions are housed in the same objects. 

Standard Scala classes are used when the questions asks for a custom data
class. 

Packages are oranised into base question types. e.g Hashmaps & Binary searches
etc.

All questions are tested using ScalaTest.


### Functional vs imperative.

I tried to keep them functional but some sets of questions just needed the
imperative approach. I am using this as a tool to teach me a functional apprach
to questions so I have undoubtedly missed elegant functional approaches to
questions.
